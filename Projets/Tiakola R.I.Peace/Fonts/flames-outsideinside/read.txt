This the first ever digitalization of this psychedelic/art nouveau typeface, that was called "Dreamline" and appeared in 60's-70's Mecanorma catalogs, the year of release was 1969 and it seems to be inspired by Alfred Roller's late 1890's-early 1900's lettering.

"Dreamline" was used extensively in records in the late 60's and early 70's, especially the ones that were made in Europe, i think that it was used as a response to the Wes Wilson lettering.

In the new update, i added the original numerals and the original "Q".

P.S. If you want to use it for a logo or something commercial, you don't need to ask me, i do not charge nothing, you're free to use it.
